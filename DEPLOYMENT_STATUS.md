## 🔄 Update Log

### 2025-08-01 17:10 UTC - Persistent Environment Variable Issue
- **Issue**: Netlify Functions cannot access environment variables
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  1. ✅ Added standard env vars (PERPLEXITY_API_KEY, CLAUDE_API_KEY)
  2. ✅ Added VITE_ prefixed versions
  3. ✅ Updated functions to check both versions
  4. ✅ Multiple deployments with cache clear
- **Result**: Functions still cannot see any of these variables
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Try adding vars in Functions-specific settings (if available)
  2. Consider using Netlify CLI to set variables
  3. May need to use a different approach (e.g., build-time injection)

### 2025-08-01 16:47 UTC - Deployment Actions
- **Actions Completed**:
  ✅ Added CLAUDE_API_KEY and PERPLEXITY_API_KEY to Netlify environment
  ✅ Pushed fixed FDA and Perplexity functions to GitHub (commit: 4445535)
  ✅ Pushed database-types.ts fix to GitHub (commit: 8cb77cb)
- **Deployment Status**: Netlify auto-deploying from GitHub push
- **Next Steps**: 
  1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Netlify deployment
  2. Retest FDA and Perplexity functions
  3. Investigate Railway database schema issue
  4. Test complete flow end-to-end

### 2025-08-01 16:41 UTC - Test Results
- **Test Status**: FAILED - Multiple critical issues
- **Issues Found**:
  1. Netlify deployed OLD code without array handling fixes
  2. FDA function still has "forEach is not a function" error
  3. Perplexity function missing API key
  4. Railway API returns empty error on /api/submissions
- **User Action**: Form submitted during test
- **Next Steps**: 
  1. Push fixed code to trigger new Netlify deployment
  2. Set PERPLEXITY_API_KEY in Netlify environment
  3. Investigate Railway database schema
  4. Retest after fixes deployed

### 2025-08-01 - Claude Assistant
- **Tasks Completed**: 
  - Created comprehensive system documentation (1700+ lines)
  - Added medical/pharmaceutical focus and URLs
  - Documented AI agents, prompts, and FDA integration

When updating this document every 60 minutes, complete these checks:

### 1. API Health Checks
```bash
# Railway API
curl -w "\nResponse Time: %{time_total}s\n" https://3cubed-seo-production.up.railway.app/health

# Netlify Functions Base
curl -I https://3cubed-seo.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/fda-query-enhanced
```

### 2. Database Check
```sql
-- In Railway Dashboard SQL console
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_submissions, 
       COUNT(CASE WHEN created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour' THEN 1 END) as last_hour,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN ai_output IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as processed
FROM submissions;
```

### 3. Error Log Review
- [ ] Check Railway logs for errors
- [ ] Check Netlify function logs
- [ ] Review any user-reported issues

### 4. Performance Metrics
- [ ] Note response times
- [ ] Check API rate limits
- [ ] Monitor database connections

## 🔧 Monitoring Scripts

### Automated Health Check Script
Save as `monitor.sh` and run via cron:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Health check script - run every 60 minutes

TIMESTAMP=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
RAILWAY_URL="https://3cubed-seo-production.up.railway.app/health"
NETLIFY_URL="https://3cubed-seo.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/fda-query-enhanced"

# Check Railway
RAILWAY_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" $RAILWAY_URL)
RAILWAY_CODE=$(echo "$RAILWAY_RESPONSE" | tail -n1)

# Check Netlify
NETLIFY_CODE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X OPTIONS $NETLIFY_URL)

# Log results
echo "[$TIMESTAMP] Railway: $RAILWAY_CODE, Netlify: $NETLIFY_CODE" >> deployment_status.log

# Send alert if down
if [ "$RAILWAY_CODE" != "200" ] || [ "$NETLIFY_CODE" != "200" ]; then
    echo "ALERT: Service down at $TIMESTAMP" | mail -s "3Cubed SEO Alert" oncall@example.com
fi
```

**Note**: This document requires manual updates every 60 minutes during active deployment periods. Consider implementing automated monitoring tools like:
- Datadog
- New Relic  
- Pingdom
- Custom webhook monitoring

For automated updates, implement a monitoring service that can write to this file or use a real-time dashboard solution.
