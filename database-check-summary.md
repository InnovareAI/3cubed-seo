# Database Verification Summary

## Problem Analysis

You need to verify if form submission data is reaching the Supabase database. The form submits to a table called `submissions` and test data should contain "test" in various fields.

## What I Found

### ‚úÖ Form Configuration
- Form submits to Supabase table: `submissions` 
- Required fields: `product_name`, `generic_name`, `indication`, `therapeutic_area`, `submitter_name`, `submitter_email`
- System fields: `priority_level`, `workflow_stage`
- Test data pattern: Look for "test" in product names, submitter names, or emails

### ‚ùå API Authentication Issue
- Direct API calls fail with "Invalid API key" error
- Suggests either expired credentials, RLS policies, or environment mismatch
- Environment variables: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### ‚úÖ Development Server Running
- App is available at http://localhost:3000/
- Can test form submission through browser interface

## Tools Created for You

### 1. **test-form-submission.html** 
Simple HTML page to test database connection and submissions
- Open in browser to test Supabase connection
- Pre-filled with test data
- Shows detailed logs and error messages
- **Usage**: Open in browser and click submit

### 2. **database-verification-guide.md**
Comprehensive guide with multiple testing approaches
- Browser console testing (recommended)
- Network tab monitoring  
- Supabase dashboard checking
- Troubleshooting steps

### 3. **submit-test-form.js** 
Node.js script that mimics exact form submission
- Currently fails due to API auth issues
- Can be updated with fresh credentials
- **Usage**: `node submit-test-form.js`

### 4. **check-test-submissions.js**
Script to query existing test submissions
- Searches for "test" in various fields
- Shows recent submissions
- Currently fails due to API auth issues

## Recommended Testing Steps

### Step 1: Browser Testing (Start Here)
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/ 
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Fill form with test data (use "test" in product name)
4. Submit and watch Console tab for:
   - "üöÄ About to submit data to Supabase:" 
   - "‚úÖ Data successfully inserted into Supabase:"
   - Any error messages

### Step 2: Alternative Browser Test
1. Open `test-form-submission.html` in browser
2. Click submit button
3. Check logs for connection and submission results

### Step 3: Network Monitoring
1. Browser Dev Tools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Submit form
3. Look for requests to `ktchrfgkbpaixbiwbieg.supabase.co`
4. Check response status codes

### Step 4: Supabase Dashboard (If Available)
1. Login to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select project: ktchrfgkbpaixbiwbieg
3. Go to Table Editor ‚Üí submissions
4. Look for recent entries with "test" data

## Expected Test Data Pattern

When testing, submissions should look like:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-here",
  "product_name": "Test Product for Database Check",
  "submitter_name": "Test Database Checker", 
  "submitter_email": "test.database@example.com",
  "created_at": "2025-07-30T...",
  "workflow_stage": "draft",
  "priority_level": "medium"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Form Shows Success But No Database Entry
- Check browser console for actual Supabase responses
- Verify API credentials haven't expired
- Check Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### If API Authentication Keeps Failing
- Get fresh API keys from Supabase project settings
- Update `.env.local` file
- Restart development server (`npm run dev`)

### If No Test Data Found
- Ensure you're submitting with "test" in the right fields
- Check if submissions are going to different table
- Verify database connection is working

## Files in Your Project

- `/src/components/SubmissionForm.tsx` - Main form component
- `/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Database configuration  
- `/.env.local` - Environment variables
- `/supabase/migrations/` - Database schema files

## Next Actions

1. **Try browser testing first** (Steps 1-2 above)
2. **If working**: Look for test entries in database
3. **If not working**: Update API credentials
4. **Report findings**: Share what you see in browser console
