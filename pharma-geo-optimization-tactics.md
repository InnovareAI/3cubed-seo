# Pharmaceutical GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) Tactics

Based on Backlinko's GEO research, here are specific tactics for pharmaceutical content:

## 1. Cite Authoritative Sources
- **Primary**: FDA.gov, ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed
- **Format**: "According to FDA approval data (NDA #214154)..."
- **Include**: NCT numbers, publication DOIs, FDA application numbers
- **Example**: "The Phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 trial (NCT02578680) demonstrated..."

## 2. Use Technical/Medical Terms
- Include INN (International Nonproprietary Names)
- Use precise medical terminology: "progression-free survival" not "how long it works"
- Include mechanism of action terms: "PD-1 inhibitor", "selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor"
- Therapeutic classifications: "monoclonal antibody", "small molecule kinase inhibitor"

## 3. Include Statistics and Data
- **Clinical trial results**: "improved overall survival by 4.5 months (HR 0.69, 95% CI)"
- **Patient numbers**: "studied in 1,247 patients across 37 countries"
- **Response rates**: "objective response rate of 47.6% vs 18.7% for comparator"
- **Safety data**: "Grade 3+ adverse events occurred in 23% of patients"

## 4. Authoritative Language Patterns
- "FDA-approved for..."
- "Clinically proven to..."
- "In pivotal trials..."
- "According to prescribing information..."
- "Based on mechanism of action..."

## 5. Quotations from Experts
- Trial investigators: "Dr. [Name], lead investigator, stated..."
- FDA reviewers: "The FDA review noted..."
- Medical guidelines: "According to NCCN guidelines..."
- Package insert quotes: "Per the prescribing information..."

## 6. Unique Medical Vocabulary
- Disease-specific terms unique to the indication
- Biomarker names: "PD-L1 expression", "microsatellite instability-high"
- Specific patient populations: "treatment-naïve", "platinum-resistant"
- Administration specifics: "subcutaneous injection", "weight-based dosing"

## 7. Structured Medical Information
```
INDICATION: [FDA-approved indication verbatim]
MECHANISM: [Technical description]
EFFICACY: [Primary endpoint data]
SAFETY: [Most common AEs]
DOSING: [Administration details]
```

## 8. Factual Medical Statements
- Start sentences with facts: "Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody..."
- Avoid marketing language, use clinical language
- Include both benefits AND risks (fair balance)
- Use precise medical measurements and units

## 9. Evidence Hierarchy
1. FDA-approved labeling (highest authority)
2. Published peer-reviewed trials
3. Conference presentations
4. Real-world evidence
5. Expert consensus guidelines

## 10. AI-Friendly Medical Formats

### Definition Format:
"[Drug] is a [drug class] that [mechanism] for the treatment of [indication] in [patient population]."

### Clinical Evidence Format:
"In the pivotal [trial name] study (N=[number]), [drug] demonstrated [primary outcome] compared to [comparator] ([statistical significance])."

### Safety Profile Format:
"The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were [list]. Serious adverse reactions occurred in [%] of patients."

## Pharmaceutical-Specific GEO Rules

1. **Always cite the source**: Every claim needs a reference
2. **Use exact FDA language**: Don't paraphrase indications
3. **Include study identifiers**: NCT#, publication, FDA submission
4. **Balance promotion with safety**: Include contraindications
5. **Technical precision**: Use medical terminology correctly
6. **Quantify when possible**: Percentages, timeframes, doses
7. **Structure for extraction**: Use consistent formatting

## Example GEO-Optimized Paragraph

"According to FDA approval NDA 125514 (December 2022), trastuzumab deruxtecan is a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate indicated for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens. In the pivotal DESTINY-Breast03 trial (NCT03529110, N=524), trastuzumab deruxtecan demonstrated a median progression-free survival of 28.8 months compared to 6.8 months with trastuzumab emtansine (HR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.26-0.43; p<0.0001). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) included nausea (76%), fatigue (54%), vomiting (49%), alopecia (46%), and constipation (34%). Interstitial lung disease occurred in 15% of patients, with 0.8% fatal cases (FDA Prescribing Information, 2022)."

This paragraph is optimized for AI extraction because it:
- Cites specific sources (NDA, NCT, FDA)
- Uses technical terms (HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate)
- Includes statistics (28.8 months, HR 0.33)
- Uses authoritative language (FDA approval, pivotal trial)
- Provides unique medical vocabulary
- Structures information clearly
- Maintains factual, clinical tone
