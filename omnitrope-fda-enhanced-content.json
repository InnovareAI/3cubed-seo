        "question": "What is Omnitrope and what is it used for?",
        "answer": "Omnitrope is an FDA-approved biosimilar version of human growth hormone (somatropin) manufactured by Sandoz. It's used to treat growth hormone deficiency in both children and adults, as well as growth failure in children due to Prader-Willi syndrome, Turner syndrome, chronic kidney disease, or being born small for gestational age."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Omnitrope as effective as brand-name growth hormone?",
        "answer": "Yes, Omnitrope has been proven to be biosimilar to Genotropin, meaning it has the same effectiveness, safety profile, and quality. Clinical studies have shown equivalent growth rates and IGF-1 responses. As the first FDA-approved biosimilar growth hormone, Omnitrope has over 15 years of real-world evidence supporting its use."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does Omnitrope cost compared to other growth hormones?",
        "answer": "Omnitrope typically costs 15-30% less than brand-name growth hormones like Genotropin, Humatrope, or Norditropin. The exact savings depend on your insurance coverage, dosage, and pharmacy. Many insurance plans prefer Omnitrope due to its lower cost, resulting in lower copayments for patients."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the side effects of Omnitrope?",
        "answer": "Common side effects include injection site reactions, headache, muscle or joint pain, and swelling. In children, temporary issues like hip pain or limping may occur. Serious but rare side effects can include increased pressure in the brain, changes in blood sugar, or allergic reactions. Always report new symptoms to your doctor."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is Omnitrope administered?",
        "answer": "Omnitrope is given as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection, typically once daily in the evening. It comes in pre-filled pen devices (Omnitrope Pen 5 and Pen 10) that make self-administration easier. Your healthcare provider will train you on proper injection technique and site rotation."
