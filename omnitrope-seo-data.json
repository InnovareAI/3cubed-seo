    {
      "question": "What is Omnitrope?",
      "answer": "Omnitrope is an FDA-approved biosimilar to human growth hormone (somatropin) used to treat growth hormone deficiency in children and adults. It's manufactured by Sandoz and offers a more affordable alternative to brand-name growth hormones."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Omnitrope work?",
      "answer": "Omnitrope works by replacing the growth hormone that your body doesn't produce enough of naturally. It stimulates growth in children, helps maintain muscle mass and bone density in adults, and regulates metabolism."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who can use Omnitrope?",
      "answer": "Omnitrope is approved for children with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency, Turner syndrome, chronic kidney disease, Prader-Willi syndrome, or being born small for gestational age. It's also approved for adults with growth hormone deficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is Omnitrope administered?",
      "answer": "Omnitrope is given as a daily subcutaneous injection, typically administered in the evening. It comes in pre-filled pen devices for easy self-administration after proper training."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the side effects of Omnitrope?",
      "answer": "Common side effects include injection site reactions, headache, and muscle pain. Serious but rare side effects can include increased intracranial pressure, glucose intolerance, and allergic reactions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Omnitrope covered by insurance?",
      "answer": "Most insurance plans cover Omnitrope for FDA-approved indications. As a biosimilar, it often has better coverage and lower copays compared to brand-name growth hormones. Sandoz also offers patient assistance programs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does Omnitrope cost?",
      "answer": "Omnitrope typically costs 15-30% less than brand-name growth hormones. The exact cost depends on dosage, insurance coverage, and pharmacy. Patient assistance programs may help reduce out-of-pocket costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Omnitrope and Genotropin?",
      "answer": "Omnitrope is a biosimilar to Genotropin, meaning it has the same active ingredient (somatropin) and works the same way. The main differences are the manufacturer, price (Omnitrope is typically less expensive), and device options."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does Omnitrope treatment last?",
      "answer": "Treatment duration varies: children typically continue until they reach their adult height or growth plates close. Adults with growth hormone deficiency may need lifelong treatment. Regular monitoring by an endocrinologist is essential."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can adults use Omnitrope?",
      "answer": "Yes, Omnitrope is FDA-approved for adults with growth hormone deficiency, either from childhood onset or acquired in adulthood due to pituitary disease, surgery, radiation, or trauma."
