# Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Implementation Guide

## What is GEO?

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of optimizing content to be discovered, understood, and cited by AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google's AI Overviews, and Bing Chat. Unlike traditional SEO which optimizes for search engines, GEO optimizes for Large Language Models (LLMs) that power AI-driven search experiences.

## Why GEO Matters for Pharmaceutical Content

1. **Changing Search Behavior**: Users increasingly turn to AI chatbots for health information
2. **Trust Building**: AI systems prefer authoritative, well-structured medical content
3. **Competitive Advantage**: Early adopters of GEO will dominate AI-generated responses
4. **Patient Journey**: AI assists patients throughout their treatment decision process
5. **HCP Efficiency**: Healthcare providers use AI for quick clinical references

## GEO vs Traditional SEO

| Aspect | Traditional SEO | GEO |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| **Target** | Search engine algorithms | AI language models |
| **Content Style** | Keyword-optimized | Conversational, Q&A format |
| **Structure** | Headers for crawlers | Clear entity relationships |
| **Goal** | Rank in SERPs | Get cited by AI |
| **Metrics** | Rankings, CTR | AI mentions, citation accuracy |

## Core GEO Principles for Pharma

### 1. **Conversational Content Structure**
```
Traditional H1: "Keytruda (Pembrolizumab) - NSCLC Treatment"
GEO H1: "What is Keytruda and How Does It Treat Lung Cancer?"
```

### 2. **Entity Recognition Optimization**
- **Drug Entity**: Clearly define product name, generic name, class
- **Disease Entity**: Link indication, symptoms, patient population  
- **Outcome Entity**: Connect treatment to measurable benefits
- **Relationship Mapping**: Drug → Mechanism → Disease → Outcome

### 3. **Question-Answer Architecture**
```markdown
## What is [Drug Name]?
[Drug Name] is a [drug class] medication that...

## How does [Drug Name] work?
[Drug Name] works by [mechanism of action]...
