### [2025-07-28 16:35] - STRATEGIC DECISION: Fresh Database Rebuild
- **Objective**: Wipe database and rebuild with clean schema (correct column types)
- **Complexity**: Medium (database rebuild) but much faster than dependency archaeology
- **Plan**:
  1. [DECISION] **APPROVED**: Fresh schema rebuild instead of view dependency hunting
  2. [TODO] Export current table schema structure (no views, no data)
  3. [TODO] Create fresh database with correct column types for 6 required fields
  4. [TODO] Deploy clean schema to Supabase
  5. [TODO] Test form submission with new clean database
  6. [TODO] Verify end-to-end flow works perfectly
- **Expected Outcome**: Clean, functional database with proper types in ~15 minutes
- **Context Window Protection**: 
  - Database: 3cubed-seo project (ktchrfgkbpaixbiwbieg)
  - **STRATEGIC**: Avoiding endless view dependency whack-a-mole
  - **NO DATA LOSS**: All 43+ submissions are test data only
  - **CLEAN SLATE**: No obsolete views, no legacy dependencies
  - **PROPER TYPES**: 6 required fields as text from the start
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Much faster than hunting down unknown number of obsolete views
  - Eliminates all legacy langchain system artifacts
  - Creates future-proof schema without historical baggage
  - React form already fixed, n8n workflow ready
- **Next Steps**: Deep Agent exports schema, creates fresh database, tests platform

FROM n8n_webhook_executions 
WHERE webhook_name = '3cubed-seo' 
ORDER BY triggered_at DESC;

-- Check recent submissions
SELECT id, product_name, ai_processing_status, workflow_stage, created_at
FROM submissions
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

2. Verify enhanced n8n workflow processes all data correctly
3. Check SEO content generation quality improvements
4. Monitor for any errors with expanded data processing

**URGENT TASK**: Update database trigger function to use correct webhook URL. 
**CRITICAL**: MUST visually verify webhook URL in n8n UI first! See "Instructions for Deep Agent" artifact.
